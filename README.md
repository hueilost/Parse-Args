# Parse-Args
#### A C/C++ program arguments parser.

#### Parse-Args is based on the python library, argparse. Yes we chose a very creative name for our project. Aside from containing a lot of the functions from argparse, implimented in a very simlar way as well, it has more abstracted functions that give you almost complete control over what you want to do with your arguments.
